## The Skeleton

> Brainpower Mode

### Context

To build your robot companion, you first need to create its skeleton, and that's where HTML comes into play. HTML serves as the blueprint that defines the structure of your robot, giving it shape and form. With HTML, you'll construct the framework that holds all your creative ideas together. Ready to start building? Let’s dive in and lay the foundation for your robot buddy!

> Throughout this quest, the principle is to iterate on your code: after completing an exercise, copy and paste your code to use it in the next one.

> Unlike what you might see in the videos, you don't need to run a server on your machine to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, thanks to the integrated code editor that handles everything for you.  
> We've kept the videos for the additional educational value they provide.

### File Naming

- For HTML files: `name-of-the-exercise.html`
- For CSS files: when required, name them as follows: `name-of-the-exercise.css`

### Instructions

Ready? Let’s code!

> The first step in your quest is to shape your robot. To do this, you need to complete two tasks:
>
> - Customize the [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) tag.
> - Customize the [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) tag.

To start any project, certain elements must be declared in the HTML file. These elements are not visible on the page but are essential for functionality.

#### The `<head>` Section:

Choose a power for your robot from the following list and set it as the `<title>`:

- invisibility
- light-speed
- super-strength
- advanced-healing
- mind-link

#### The `<body>` Section:

This section contains the content of your webpage. In our case, it represents the lower body of your robot. Define the skeleton of your robot by organizing it into three main sections: the face, the upper body, and the lower body. Inside the `<body>` tag of your HTML file, create three divisions using `<section>` tags, and place the following text content inside each one: `face`, `upper-body`, `lower-body`.

> Don’t forget to press "Render" again to refresh the display page after modifying your code.

### Code Examples

To create a `div` tag with `hello` as the text content inside the `body`:

```html
<body>
  <div>hello</div>
</body>
```

> Hint: Remember to include the `<head>` and `<body>` tags! Although browsers may automatically insert them if omitted, it's a better practice to explicitly add them for improved structure and readability ;)
