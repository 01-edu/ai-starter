### AI-Powered Learning Techniques

As you embark on this quest, using AI tools can significantly enhance your learning experience.

A key skill is mastering how to `Speak AI`, which involves knowing how to ask AI the right questions to get the answers you need while learning.

Here are a few essential concepts to understand:

> **A prompt** is a question or instruction given to a generative AI to produce a specific response or action, helping users learn or achieve a desired outcome.

> **Generative AI** is an innovative tool that aids learning by generating new content, such as text and images, based on existing examples and your prompts, making the learning process more dynamic and engaging!

**Suggested Free Generative AI Tools:**

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
- [Phind](https://www.phind.com/)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)

For example:

### Metaphor Explanation Technique

This type of prompt encourages the AI to explain complex concepts using simple metaphors, making them easier to understand.

**`Prompt Example`**

- "Explain what a variable is in JavaScript using a metaphor."

**How to Use It with ChatGPT:**

1. **Open your preferred Generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT)**: Visit [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and start a new chat session.
2. **Enter the Prompt**: Type or paste your prompt into the chat. For example, "Explain what a variable is in JavaScript using a metaphor."
3. **Review the Response**: ChatGPT will provide a metaphorical explanation. For instance:

   > "A variable in JavaScript is like a labeled jar that you can store items in. You can put different things into the jar (like numbers, strings, or objects) and label it with a name so you can easily find and use the contents later. For example: `let myJar = 'Cookies';`."

4. **Ask Follow-Up Questions and Compare Results with Your Peers**: If you need further clarification or additional metaphors, you can ask follow-up questions!

Similar to this technique, we will explore a new way to learn with AI in each upcoming exercise, helping you achieve your goals collaboratively with your peers.

> Remember, we use AI as a tool to deepen our understanding of concepts, not to simply get ready-made answers! So, collaborate with your peers. ;)

### Task:

Write the following line of code in the code editor. Put `Yes` between the quotes, then submit it:

```js
let ready = "";
```

You just declared a variable! What does that mean? Letâ€™s move on to the next exercise, where you will learn how to `declare everything`!
