### Context

Youâ€™ve reached the final mission to unlock your full potential, which will bring your robot to life and make it fully functional!

The last step involves mastering the use of `arguments` in functions. By learning how to use and manage these `arguments` effectively, you can unlock the full potential of your robot and truly bring it to life.

Letâ€™s dive in!

### Concepts

#### One Argument

As mentioned earlier with methods, functions can take arguments. These arguments are always placed between parentheses `()`.

Letâ€™s revisit the examples we used for function calls:

Remember this example of a function call?

```js
//       â†™ method
console.log("Hello There!"); //<-
//                 â†– The string 'Hello There!' is
//                   the argument of console.log()
```

Now, letâ€™s adapt `myFirstFunction` so that it takes one argument: `arg1`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1) => {
  //<-arg1 is inputted between the parentheses
  console.log(arg1); // arg1 can be used inside the scope of the function
  //            â†–   arg1 is "transferred" to be the argument of console.log()
}; //<-end of the scope of the function
```

When the function is called, it displays the output of `console.log(arg1)`.

```js
myFirstFunction("using my first arg"); // "using my first arg"
```

If you want to change what the function logs, instead of modifying `myFirstFunction`, you just need to modify the `argument` in the `function call`.

```js
myFirstFunction("another arg"); // "another arg"
myFirstFunction("and another one"); // "and another one"
myFirstFunction("and one more"); // "and one more"
```

#### More Arguments

Weâ€™ve seen how to add `one` argument to a function. Now, letâ€™s learn how to add `two (or more)` arguments.

To add a second argument `arg2`, simply add a comma `,` after `arg1` and then include `arg2`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2) => {
  //<-arg1 and arg2 are inputted between the parentheses
  console.log(arg1, arg2);
  //            â†–   arg1 and arg2 are "transferred" to be the arguments of console.log()
};
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction("first arg", "second arg");
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
```

For additional arguments, repeat the same process: add a comma `,` followed by the next argument.

> Note: You can name your arguments however you like. Just ensure you use the correct names inside the functionâ€™s scope.

#### Return Value

In addition to accepting arguments, functions can also `return` values.

Return values are the `outputs` that a function provides after completing its task.

Letâ€™s adapt `myFirstFunction` so that it `returns` a value instead of just `logging` it.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1) => {
  return arg1; // the function now returns the value of arg1
};
```

When the function is called, it returns the value of `arg1`:

```js
let result = myFirstFunction("using my first return");
console.log(result); // "using my first return"
```

If you want to change what the function `returns`, instead of modifying `myFirstFunction`, you just need to modify `the argument` in `the function call`.

```js
let anotherResult = myFirstFunction("another return");
console.log(anotherResult); // "another return"
```

#### **`Prompt Example`**:

- "Can you guide me through creating and using a JavaScript function that takes multiple arguments, starting from a basic function without arguments, then adding single and multiple arguments?"

### Instructions

#### Task 1:

You are the generalâ€™s aide responsible for transmitting communications to the other `RoboGuards`.

1. Create the `battleCry` Function:

- This function should take `one argument` and display it in the `console`.
- The battlefield is vast, so ensure that `the argument is uppercased` before displaying it.

2. Create the `secretOrders` Function:

- Sometimes, communications need to be given quietly.
- This function will do the `same` as `battleCry`, except it will `lowercase` the argument before sending it.

> Hint: Do you remember methods?

#### Task 2:

As the leader of the RoboGuard forces, youâ€™re not just preparing for battleâ€”youâ€™re also forming dynamic duos of robots to work together on special missions.

1. Create the `duos` Function:

- This function will take `two arguments`, representing the **names** of **two robots**.
- It will `log them` together with a space, the word **and**, another space, and end the sentence with an **exclamation mark**.

> Example output: "robotOne and robotTwo!"

2. Create the `duosWork` Function:

- This function will take `three arguments`: the **names** of two robots and the **task** they will perform together.
- It will `log them` together in a sentence describing their task with the same formatting as below.

> Example output: "robotOne and robotTwo are saying hi!"

#### Task 3:

Rickâ€™s robot knows its purpose. (Remember? "He passes butter.")

- Define the function `passButter` that returns the string "The butter."
