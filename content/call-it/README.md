## Call it

### Context

Congratulations! You've created the very first base for your entity and witnessed its appearance in the Digital World - your browser. However, it is still a tiny seed of the marvelous thing it could become. Be patient; there's still some work to do.

### Directions

First, instead of writing down what things are _(you're not writing the word 'hand' on your hand, are you?)_, we'll identify them semantically using the very practical [id attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id). This `id` must be a **unique** identifier on your webpage, allowing you to target your element when needed. You can think of it like your name and surname; this is what identifies you to others, and if someone calls you by your name, you respond.

### Instructions

Let's identify the 3 elements we have so far: in each section, remove the text content from inside the tag and set it as the value of the `id` attribute of the corresponding `section` tag.

**Run your code in the editor preview:** \
Don't see _anything_? Don't panic! \
Inspect the HTML that has been created using your [browser inspector tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools). If you've done it correctly, you should see the 3 sections inside the `body` with the `id` attribute set in your HTML structure.

### Code examples

To set the `id` of a `div` tag to `"my-lil-div"`:

```html
<div id="my-lil-div"></div>
```
