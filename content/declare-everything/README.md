### Context

In this second quest of our adventure, you will enhance your skills with JavaScript. Initially, in this exercise, you'll use variables to control and manage robots in various scenarios. Let's dive in and explore the basics of variables in JavaScript!

### Directions

Values need a way to be identified, which is why we use variables. Variables add meaning to a value by pointing to it. Think of them as **labels**, a way to name things.

If we say `20`, it doesn't carry much meaning. _`20` what?_

Imagine we are talking about robots. You have 20 robot parts.

_Now that's a lot of parts!_

> We defined _what_ we have (robot parts) and its _value_ (20).

## Concepts

An `identifier` is used to define what it is, using this syntax:

```js
let robotParts = 20;
```

> ðŸ˜± Whoa, what's all this?!

Let's break it down:

### Keyword: `let`

First, a keyword: `let`.

A keyword is a special word that JavaScript recognizes. It is used to tell the computer to perform a specific action.

`let` indicates that the script is defining a new variable.

### Identifier

Next, it needs a valid identifier.

In this case, it's `robotParts`. We choose something meaningful here.

A few rules apply to ensure an identifier is valid:

- No spaces are allowed (`robot parts` would be interpreted as two distinct identifiers, resulting in a malformed `let` expression).
- It cannot start with a number (that's reserved for numeric values).
- It cannot be a reserved keyword (for example, using `let` as an identifier).
- No special characters are allowed.

As such, we use what's called `camelCase`.

Note that in JavaScript, it is a convention not to uppercase the first letter, as this is reserved for special declarations. We won't go into details now.

```js
let robot parts = 20 // Invalid because of spaces
let robotParts = 20 // Just right
```

### Operator: `=`

The special character `=` is an **operator**. Like in math, operators are used to define specific operations. In this case, `=` defines the `assignment` operation. It means assigning a value to our variable. This is what **links** the chosen `identifier` with our `value`.

#### **`Prompt example`**:

"Why do we use camelCase for variable names in JavaScript?"

### Value

Finally, a value, like the ones you already know: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. Here's a full example with descriptive comments:

```js
// â†™ keyword        â†™ assignment operator
let comicBookTitle = "Tintin in Tibet";
//       â†– identifier       â†– the value (here a string)
```

#### **`Prompt example`**:

"As a beginner, what types of values can I assign to a variable in JavaScript?"

### Instructions

Declare two variables:

- Use the identifier `seven` with the value being a string of the number `7`.
- Use the identifier `seventySeven` with the value being a string of the number `77`.
